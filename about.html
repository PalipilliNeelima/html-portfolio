<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Neelima Palipilli! I’m a Artificial Intelligent student passionate about automation and building software that solves real-world problems.</p>
<p>I enjoy working with tools like Python and Automation Anywhere to create efficient workflows and data-driven solutions. I love exploring how technology can simplify complex tasks and help businesses make smarter decisions.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m focused on sharpening my skills in full-stack development and cloud technologies, and I’m actively seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world projects and internships.</p>
<p>When I’m not coding or learning new frameworks, you’ll probably find me experimenting with AI tools, solving logic puzzles, or sketching in my free time.</p>
